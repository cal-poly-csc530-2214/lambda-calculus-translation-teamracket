Write a compiler that accepts terms in the lambda calculus and outputs either JavaScript or Python or (massively harder) C.

Here’s the grammar of the input language:
    LC	 	=	 	num 
    
 	 	|	 	id
    
 	 	|	 	(/ id => LC) 
    
 	 	|	 	(LC LC)
    
    |	 	(+ LC LC) 
    
 	 	|	 	(* LC LC) 
    
 	 	|	 	(ifleq0 LC LC LC) 
    
 	 	|	 	(println LC) 
    
 ...where num is a number, and id is an identifier.
